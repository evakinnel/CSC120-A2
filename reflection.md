What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It worked for me to smart small with something I knew I could accomplish and work my way up. At the end, I don't have a perfect product, but I was able to do a lot more than it felt like I could at the beginning. 
It also worked to look through the professor's examples, my own past code, and some things on the internet if it was easy to search.
As is mentioned throughout my other documents, I couldn't find the right code/concept in order to get the classes working together in the proper way which was frustrating. 
For a future student/self, I would probably say to begin earlier, so that I can plan for student or TA hours if needed. Or else, probably to work with someone else in the class to fill in gaps for each other (or at least share in the frustration) ;)
